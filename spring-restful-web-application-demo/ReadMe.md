This project is built using maven3, spring4(Spring boot) and angularjs1.5.

Spring4 is a popular framework, annotation is strongly recommended in this version.

Spring boot makes create web site much easier than before.

I also use 'nekohtml', it enables spring to use the standard XML scanner to parse HTML document.

Mockito is used to do unit test for this framework.

AngularJS is quite useful for the development of single page application.

It divides the code into small pieces and thus make it possible to do a good unit test.

It takes me about 3 hours to finish this project.
