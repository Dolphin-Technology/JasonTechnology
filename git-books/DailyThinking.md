Gson and Jackson can both be used to parse Json String & Objects  - What is the difference?

These days, I use GraphQL as it is required by workflow innovation project. GraphQL seems promising, however, there is no utility 
to convert between JSON string and GraphQL query - Is it possible to write a utility?

When I read Gson, I noticed it uses Type, and I noticed interface have implicitly public method from Object, although it does not inherit from Object.
Why is it designed this way?
